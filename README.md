# Identification-of-the-quality-of-reanalyses-around-the-Earth-Are-they-worth-in-Antarct
An internship project by Gateway Antarctica, University of Canterbury. 
This project examined whether the various atmospheric reanalyses 
available are consistent around the world by using pattern 
classification algorithm, Self-Organizing Map, applied to the 
near-surface horizontal wind fields from the present day back 
to 1900.
Tools:   Self-Organizing Maps、python 、numpy、
pandas、matplotlib、xarray、seaborn、EOF/PCA
